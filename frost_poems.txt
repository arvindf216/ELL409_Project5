i'm going out to clean the pasture spring
i'll only stop to rake the leaves away
and wait to watch the water clear, i may
i shan't be gone long you come too 
i'm going out to fetch the little calf
that's standing by the mother it's so young,
it totters when she licks it with her tongue 
i shan't be gone long you come too 
something inspires the only cow of late
to make no more of a wall than an open gate,
and think no more of wall builders than fools 
her face is flecked with pomace and she drools
a cider syrup having tasted fruit,
she scorns a pasture withering to the root 
she runs from tree to tree where lie and sweeten
the windfalls spiked with stubble and worm eaten 
she leaves them bitten when she has to fly 
she bellows on a knoll against the sky 
her udder shrivels and the milk goes dry 
once when the snow of the year was beginning to
fall, we stopped by a mountain pasture to say whose
colt a little morgan had one forefoot on the wall,
the other curled at his breast he dipped his head
and snorted at us and then he had to bolt 
we heard the miniature thunder where he fled,
and we saw him, or thought we saw him, dim and
grey, like a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes 
i think the little fellow's afraid of the snow 
he isn't winter broken it isn't play
with the little fellow at all he's running away 
i doubt if even his mother could tell him, 'sakes,
it's only weather ' he'd think she didn't know
where is his mother he can't be out alone 
and now he comes again with a clatter of stone
and mounts the wall again with whited eyes
and all his tail that isn't hair up straight 
he shudders his coat as if to throw off flies 
whoever it is that leaves him out so late,
when other creatures have gone to stall and bin,
ought to be told to come and take him in 
all out of doors looked darkly in at him
through the thin frost, almost in separate stars,
that gathers on the pane in empty rooms 
what kept his eyes from giving back the gaze
was the lamp tilted near them in his hand 
what kept him from remembering what it was
that brought him to that creaking room was age 
he stood with barrels round him at a loss 
and having scared the cellar under him
in clomping there, he scared it once again
in clomping off and scared the outer night,
which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar
of trees and crack of branches, common things,
but nothing so like beating on a box 
a light he was to no one but himself
where now he sat, concerned with he knew what,
a quiet light, and then not even that 
he consigned to the moon, such as she was,
so late arising, to the broken moon
as better than the sun in any case
for such a charge, his snow upon the roof,
his icicles along the wall to keep
and slept the log that shifted with a jolt
once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,
and eased his heavy breathing, but still slept 
one aged man one man can't keep a house,
a farm, a countryside, or if he can,
it's thus he does it of a winter night 
he saw her from the bottom of the stairs
before she saw him she was starting down,
looking back over her shoulder at some fear 
she took a doubtful step and then undid it
to raise herself and look again he spoke
advancing toward her what is it you see
from up there always for i want to know 
she turned and sank upon her skirts at that,
and her face changed from terrified to dull 
he said to gain time what is it you see
mounting until she cowered under him 
i will find out now you must tell me, dear 
she, in her place, refused him any help
with the least stiffening of her neck and silence 
she let him look, sure that he wouldn't see,
blind creature and a while he didn't see 
but at last he murmured, oh, and again, oh 
what is it what she said 
just that i see 
you don't, she challenged tell me what it is 
the wonder is i didn't see at once 
i never noticed it from here before 
i must be wonted to it that's the reason 
the little graveyard where my people are
so small the window frames the whole of it 
not so much larger than a bedroom, is it
there are three stones of slate and one of marble,
broad shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight
on the sidehill we haven't to mind those 
but i understand it is not the stones,
but the child's mound
don't, don't, don't, don't, she cried 
she withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm
that rested on the banister, and slid downstairs
and turned on him with such a daunting look,
he said twice over before he knew himself
can't a man speak of his own child he's lost
not you oh, where's my hat oh, i don't
need it i must get out of here i must get air 
i don't know rightly whether any man can 
amy don't go to someone else this time 
listen to me i won't come down the stairs 
he sat and fixed his chin between his fists 
there's something i should like to ask you, dear 
you don't know how to ask it 
help me, then her fingers moved the latch for all reply 
my words are nearly always an offence 
i don't know how to speak of anything
so as to please you but i might be taught
i should suppose i can't say i see how 
a man must partly give up being a man
with women folk we could have some
arrangement by which i'd bind myself to keep hands off
anything special you're a mind to name 
though i don't like such things 'twixt those that
love two that don't love can't live together without
them but two that do can't live together with them 
she moved the latch a little don't don't go 
don't carry it to someone else this time 
tell me about it if it's something human 
let me into your grief i'm not so much
unlike other folks as your standing there
apart would make me out give me my chance 
i do think, though, you overdo it a little 
what was it brought you up to think it the thing
to take your mother loss of a first child
so inconsolably in the face of love 
you'd think his memory might be satisfied
there you go sneering now
i'm not, i'm not
you make me angry i'll come down to you 
god, what a woman and it's come to this,
a man can't speak of his own child that's dead 
you can't because you don't know how 
if you had any feelings, you that dug
with your own hand how could you his little
grave i saw you from that very window there,
making the gravel leap and leap in air,
leap up, like that, like that, and land so lightly
and roll back down the mound beside the hole 
i thought, who is that man i didn't know you 
and i crept down the stairs and up the stairs
to look again, and still your spade kept lifting 
then you came in i heard your rumbling voice
out in the kitchen, and i don't know why,
but i went near to see with my own eyes 
you could sit there with the stains on your shoes
of the fresh earth from your own baby's grave
and talk about your everyday concerns 
you had stood the spade up against the wall
outside there in the entry, for i saw it 
i shall laugh the worst laugh i ever laughed 
i'm cursed god, if i don't believe i'm cursed 
i can repeat the very words you were saying 
three foggy mornings and one rainy day
will rot the best birch fence a man can build 
think of it, talk like that at such a time
what had how long it takes a birch to rot
to do with what was in the darkened parlour
you couldn't care the nearest friends can go
with anyone to death, comes so far short
they might as well not try to go at all 
no, from the time when one is sick to death,
one is alone, and he dies more alone 
friends make pretence of following to the grave,
but before one is in it, their minds are turned
and making the best of their way back to life
and living people, and things they understand 
but the world's evil i won't have grief so
if i can change it oh, i won't, i won't
there, you have said it all and you feel better 
you won't go now you're crying close the door 
the heart's gone out of it why keep it up
amy there's someone coming down the road
you oh, you think the talk is all i must go
somewhere out of this house how can i make
you if you do she was opening the door wider 
where do you mean to go first tell me that 
i'll follow and bring you back by force i will 
mary sat musing on the lamp flame at the table
waiting for warren when she heard his step,
she ran on tip toe down the darkened passage
to meet him in the doorway with the news
and put him on his guard silas is back 
she pushed him outward with her through the door
and shut it after her be kind, she said 
she took the market things from warren's arms
and set them on the porch, then drew him down
to sit beside her on the wooden steps 
when was i ever anything but kind to him
but i'll not have the fellow back, he said 
i told him so last haying, didn't i
if he left then,' i said, 'that ended it 
what good is he who else will harbour him
at his age for the little he can do
what help he is there's no depending on 
off he goes always when i need him most 
he thinks he ought to earn a little pay,
enough at least to buy tobacco with,
so he won't have to beg and be beholden 
all right,' i say, 'i can't afford to pay
any fixed wages, though i wish i could 
someone else can ' 'then someone else will have
to i shouldn't mind his bettering himself
if that was what it was you can be certain,
when he begins like that, there's someone at him
trying to coax him off with pocket money,
in haying time, when any help is scarce 
in winter he comes back to us i'm done 
sh not so loud he'll hear you, mary said 
i want him to he'll have to soon or late 
he's worn out he's asleep beside the stove 
when i came up from rowe's i found him here,
huddled against the barn door fast asleep,
a miserable sight, and frightening, too
you needn't smile i didn't recognise him
i wasn't looking for him and he's changed 
wait till you see 
where did you say he'd been
he didn't say i dragged him to the house,
and gave him tea and tried to make him smoke 
i tried to make him talk about his travels 
nothing would do he just kept nodding off 
what did he say did he say anything
but little anything mary, confess
he said he'd come to ditch the meadow for me 
warren but did he i just want to know 
of course he did what would you have him say
surely you wouldn't grudge the poor old man
some humble way to save his self respect 
he added, if you really care to know,
he meant to clear the upper pasture, too 
that sounds like something you have heard before
warren, i wish you could have heard the way
he jumbled everything i stopped to look
two or three times he made me feel so queer
to see if he was talking in his sleep 
he ran on harold wilson you remember
the boy you had in haying four years since 
he's finished school, and teaching in his college 
silas declares you'll have to get him back 
he says they two will make a team for work
between them they will lay this farm as smooth
the way he mixed that in with other things 
he thinks young wilson a likely lad, though daft
on education you know how they fought
all through july under the blazing sun,
silas up on the cart to build the load,
harold along beside to pitch it on 
yes, i took care to keep well out of earshot 
well, those days trouble silas like a dream 
you wouldn't think they would how some things
linger harold's young college boy's assurance piqued him 
after so many years he still keeps finding
good arguments he sees he might have used 
i sympathise i know just how it feels
to think of the right thing to say too late 
harold's associated in his mind with latin 
he asked me what i thought of harold's saying
he studied latin like the violin
because he liked it that an argument
he said he couldn't make the boy believe
he could find water with a hazel prong
which showed how much good school had ever done
him he wanted to go over that but most of all
he thinks if he could have another chance
to teach him how to build a load of hay
i know, that's silas' one accomplishment 
he bundles every forkful in its place,
and tags and numbers it for future reference,
so he can find and easily dislodge it
in the unloading silas does that well 
he takes it out in bunches like big birds' nests 
you never see him standing on the hay
he's trying to lift, straining to lift himself 
he thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be
some good perhaps to someone in the world 
he hates to see a boy the fool of books 
poor silas, so concerned for other folk,
and nothing to look backward to with pride,
and nothing to look forward to with hope,
so now and never any different 
part of a moon was falling down the west,
dragging the whole sky with it to the hills 
its light poured softly in her lap she saw
and spread her apron to it she put out her hand
among the harp like morning glory strings,
taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,
as if she played unheard the tenderness
that wrought on him beside her in the night 
warren, she said, he has come home to die
you needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time 
home, he mocked gently 
yes, what else but home
it all depends on what you mean by home 
of course he's nothing to us, any more
than was the hound that came a stranger to us
out of the woods, worn out upon the trail 
home is the place where, when you have to go
there, they have to take you in 
i should have called it
something you somehow haven't to deserve 
warren leaned out and took a step or two,
picked up a little stick, and brought it back
and broke it in his hand and tossed it by 
silas has better claim on us, you think,
than on his brother thirteen little miles
as the road winds would bring him to his door 
silas has walked that far no doubt to day 
why didn't he go there his brother's rich,
a somebody director in the bank 
he never told us that 
we know it though 
i think his brother ought to help, of course 
i'll see to that if there is need he ought of right
to take him in, and might be willing to
he may be better than appearances 
but have some pity on silas do you think
if he'd had any pride in claiming kin
or anything he looked for from his brother,
he'd keep so still about him all this time
i wonder what's between them 
i can tell you 
silas is what he is we wouldn't mind him
but just the kind that kinsfolk can't abide 
he never did a thing so very bad 
he don't know why he isn't quite as good
as anyone he won't be made ashamed
to please his brother, worthless though he is 
i can't think si ever hurt anyone 
no, but he hurt my heart the way he lay
and rolled his old head on that sharp edged
chair back he wouldn't let me put him on the lounge 
you must go in and see what you can do 
i made the bed up for him there to night 
you'll be surprised at him how much he's broken 
his working days are done i'm sure of it 
i'd not be in a hurry to say that 
i haven't been go, look, see for yourself 
but, warren, please remember how it is
he's come to help you ditch the meadow 
he has a plan you mustn't laugh at him 
he may not speak of it, and then he may 
i'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud
will hit or miss the moon 
it hit the moon 
then there were three there, making a dim row,
the moon, the little silver cloud, and she 
warren returned too soon, it seemed to her,
slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited 
warren, she questioned dead, was all he answered 
i didn't make you know how glad i was
to have you come and camp here on our land 
i promised myself to get down some day
and see the way you lived, but i don't know
with a houseful of hungry men to feed
i guess you'd find it seems to me
i can't express my feelings any more
than i can raise my voice or want to lift
my hand (oh, i can lift it when i have to) 
did ever you feel so i hope you never 
it's got so i don't even know for sure
whether i am glad, sorry, or anything 
there's nothing but a voice like left inside
that seems to tell me how i ought to feel,
and would feel if i wasn't all gone wrong 
you take the lake i look and look at it 
i see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water 
i stand and make myself repeat out loud
the advantages it has, so long and narrow,
like a deep piece of some old running river
cut short off at both ends it lies five miles
straight away through the mountain notch
from the sink window where i wash the plates,
and all our storms come up toward the house,
drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and
whiter it took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit
to step outdoors and take the water dazzle
a sunny morning, or take the rising wind
about my face and body and through my wrapper,
when a storm threatened from the dragon's den,
and a cold chill shivered across the lake 
i see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water,
our willoughby how did you hear of it
i expect, though, everyone's heard of it 
in a book about ferns listen to that
you let things more like feathers regulate
your going and coming and you like it here
i can see how you might but i don't know
it would be different if more people came,
for then there would be business as it is,
the cottages len built, sometimes we rent them,
sometimes we don't we've a good piece of shore
that ought to be worth something, and may yet 
but i don't count on it as much as len 
he looks on the bright side of everything,
including me he thinks i'll be all right
with doctoring but it's not medicine
lowe is the only doctor's dared to say so
it's rest i want there, i have said it out
from cooking meals for hungry hired men
and washing dishes after them from doing
things over and over that just won't stay done 
by good rights i ought not to have so much
put on me, but there seems no other way 
len says one steady pull more ought to do it 
he says the best way out is always through 
and i agree to that, or in so far
as that i can see no way out but through
leastways for me and then they'll be convinced 
it's not that len don't want the best for me 
it was his plan our moving over in
beside the lake from where that day i showed you
we used to live ten miles from anywhere
we didn't change without some sacrifice,
but len went at it to make up the loss 
his work's a man's, of course, from sun to sun,
but he works when he works as hard as i do
though there's small profit in comparisons 
women and men will make them all the same 
but work ain't all len undertakes too much 
he's into everything in town this year
it's highways, and he's got too many men
around him to look after that make waste 
they take advantage of him shamefully,
and proud, too, of themselves for doing so 
we have four here to board, great good for nothings,
sprawling about the kitchen with their talk
while i fry their bacon much they care
no more put out in what they do or say
than if i wasn't in the room at all 
coming and going all the time, they are
i don't learn what their names are, let alone
their characters, or whether they are safe
to have inside the house with doors unlocked 
i'm not afraid of them, though, if they're not
afraid of me there's two can play at that 
i have my fancies it runs in the family 
my father's brother wasn't right they kept him
locked up for years back there at the old farm 
i've been away once yes, i've been away 
the state asylum i was prejudiced
i wouldn't have sent anyone of mine there
you know the old idea the only asylum
was the poorhouse, and those who could afford,
rather than send their folks to such a place,
kept them at home and it does seem more human 
but it's not so the place is the asylum 
there they have every means proper to do with,
and you aren't darkening other people's lives
worse than no good to them, and they no good
to you in your condition you can't know
affection or the want of it in that state 
i've heard too much of the old fashioned way 
my father's brother, he went mad quite young 
some thought he had been bitten by a dog,
because his violence took on the form
of carrying his pillow in his teeth
but it's more likely he was crossed in love,
or so the story goes it was some girl 
anyway, all he talked about was love 
they soon saw he would do someone a mischief
if he wa'n't kept strict watch of, and it ended
in father's building him a sort of cage,
or room within a room, of hickory poles,
like stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,
a narrow passage all the way around 
anything they put in for furniture
he'd tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on 
so they made the place comfortable with straw,
like a beast's stall, to ease their consciences 
of course they had to feed him without dishes 
they tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded
with his clothes on his arm all of his clothes 
cruel it sounds i s'pose they did the best
they knew and just when he was at the height,
father and mother married, and mother came,
a bride, to help take care of such a creature,
and accommodate her young life to his 
that was what marrying father meant to her 
she had to lie and hear love things made dreadful
by his shouts in the night he'd shout and shout
until the strength was shouted out of him,
and his voice died down slowly from exhaustion 
he'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow string,
and let them go and make them twang until
his hands had worn them smooth as any ox bow 
and then he'd crow as if he thought that child's
play the only fun he had i've heard them say, though,
they found a way to put a stop to it 
he was before my time i never saw him
but the pen stayed exactly as it was
there in the upper chamber in the ell,
a sort of catch all full of attic clutter 
i often think of the smooth hickory bars 
it got so i would say you know, half fooling
it's time i took my turn upstairs in jail
just as you will till it becomes a habit 
no wonder i was glad to get away 
mind you, i waited till len said the word 
i didn't want the blame if things went wrong 
i was glad though, no end, when we moved out,
and i looked to be happy, and i was,
as i said, for a while but i don't know
somehow the change wore out like a prescription 
and there's more to it than just window views
and living by a lake i'm past such help
unless len took the notion, which he won't,
and i won't ask him it's not sure enough 
i 'spose i've got to go the road i'm going
other folks have to, and why shouldn't i
i almost think if i could do like you,
drop everything and live out on the ground
but it might be, come night, i shouldn't like it,
or a long rain i should soon get enough,
and be glad of a good roof overhead 
i've lain awake thinking of you, i'll warrant,
more than you have yourself, some of these nights 
the wonder was the tents weren't snatched away
from over you as you lay in your beds 
i haven't courage for a risk like that 
bless you, of course, you're keeping me from work,
but the thing of it is, i need to be kept 
there's work enough to do there's always that
but behind's behind the worst that you can do
is set me back a little more behind 
i shan't catch up in this world, anyway 
i'd rather you'd not go unless you must 
willis, i didn't want you here to day
the lawyer's coming for the company 
i'm going to sell my soul, or, rather, feet 
five hundred dollars for the pair, you know 
with you the feet have nearly been the soul
and if you're going to sell them to the devil,
i want to see you do it when's he coming
i half suspect you knew, and came on purpose
to try to help me drive a better bargain 
well, if it's true yours are no common feet 
the lawyer don't know what it is he's buying
so many miles you might have walked you won't
walk you haven't run your forty orchids down 
what does he think how are the blessed feet
the doctor's sure you're going to walk again
he thinks i'll hobble it's both legs and feet 
they must be terrible i mean to look at 
i haven't dared to look at them uncovered 
through the bed blankets i remind myself
of a starfish laid out with rigid points 
the wonder is it hadn't been your head 
it's hard to tell you how i managed it 
when i saw the shaft had me by the coat,
i didn't try too long to pull away,
or fumble for my knife to cut away,
i just embraced the shaft and rode it out
till weiss shut off the water in the wheel pit 
that's how i think i didn't lose my head,
but my legs got their knocks against the ceiling 
awful why didn't they throw off the belt
instead of going clear down in the wheel pit
they say sometime was wasted on the belt
old streak of leather doesn't love me much
because i made him spit fire at my knuckles,
the way ben franklin used to make the kite string 
that must be it some days he won't stay on 
that day a woman couldn't coax him off 
he's on his rounds now with his tail in his mouth
snatched right and left across the silver pulleys 
everything goes the same without me there 
you can hear the small buzz saws whine, the big saw
caterwaul to the hills around the village
as they both bite the wood it's all our music 
one ought as a good villager to like it 
no doubt it has a sort of prosperous sound,
and it's our life 
yes, when it's not our death 
you make that sound as if it wasn't so
with everything what we live by we die by 
i wonder where my lawyer is his train's in 
i want this over with i'm hot and tired 
you're getting ready to do something foolish 
watch for him, will you, will you let him in 
i'd rather mrs corbin didn't know
i've boarded here so long, she thinks she owns me 
you're bad enough to manage without her 
and i'm going to be worse instead of better 
you've got to tell me how far this is gone
have you agreed to any price
five hundred five hundred five five one, two, three, four,
five you needn't look at me 
i don't believe you 
i told you, willis, when you first came in 
don't you be hard on me i have to take
what i can get you see they have the feet,
which gives them the advantage in the trade 
i can't get back the feet in any case 
but your flowers, man, you're selling out your
flowers yes, that's one way to put it all the flowers
of every kind everywhere in this region
for the next forty summers call it forty 
but i'm not selling those, i'm giving them,
they never earned me so much as one cent
money can't pay me for the loss of them 
no, the five hundred was the sum they named
to pay the doctor's bill and tide me over 
it's that or fight, and i don't want to fight
i just want to get settled in my life,
such as it's going to be, and know the worst,
or best it may not be so bad the firm
promise me all the shooks i want to nail 
but what about your flora of the valley
you have me there but that you didn't think
that was worth money to me still, i own
it goes against me not to finish it
for the friends it might bring me by the way,
i had a letter from burroughs did i tell you 
about my cyprepedium reginœ
he says it's not reported so far north 
there there's the bell he's rung but you go
down and bring him up, and don't let mrs corbin 
oh, well, we'll soon be through with it i'm tired 
willis brought up besides the boston lawyer
a little barefoot girl who in the noise
of heavy footsteps in the old frame house,
and baritone importance of the lawyer,
stood for a while unnoticed with her hands
shyly behind her well, and how is mister
the lawyer was already in his satchel
as if for papers that might bear the name
he hadn't at command you must excuse me,
i dropped in at the mill and was detained 
looking round, i suppose, said willis 
yes, well, yes 
hear anything that might prove useful
the broken one saw anne why, here is anne
what do you want, dear come, stand by the bed
tell me what is it anne just wagged her dress
with both hands held behind her guess, she
said oh, guess which hand my, my once on a
time i knew a lovely way to tell for certain
by looking in the ears but i forget it 
er, let me see i think i'll take the right 
that's sure to be right even if it's wrong 
come, hold it out don't change a ram's horn
orchid a ram's horn what would i have got, i wonder,
if i had chosen left hold out the left 
another ram's horn where did you find those,
under what beech tree, on what woodchuck's knoll
anne looked at the large lawyer at her side,
and thought she wouldn't venture on so much 
were there no others
there were four or five 
i knew you wouldn't let me pick them all 
i wouldn't so i wouldn't you're the girl
you see anne has her lesson learned by heart 
i wanted there should be some there next year 
of course you did you left the rest for seed,
and for the backwoods woodchuck you're the girl
a ram's horn orchid seedpod for a woodchuck
sounds something like better than farmer's beans
to a discriminating appetite,
though the ram's horn is seldom to be had
in bushel lots doesn't come on the market 
but, anne, i'm troubled have you told me all
you're hiding something that's as bad as lying 
you ask this lawyer man and it's not safe
with a lawyer at hand to find you out 
nothing is hidden from some people, anne 
you don't tell me that where you found a ram's
horn you didn't find a yellow lady's slipper 
what did i tell you what i'd blush, i would 
don't you defend yourself if it was there,
where is it now, the yellow lady's slipper
well, wait it's common it's too common 
common the purple lady's slipper's commoner 
i didn't bring a purple lady's slipper
to you to you i mean they're both too
common the lawyer gave a laugh among his papers
as if with some idea that she had scored 
i've broken anne of gathering bouquets 
it's not fair to the child it can't be helped
though pressed into service means pressed out of shape 
somehow i'll make it right with her she'll see 
she's going to do my scouting in the field,
over stone walls and all along a wood
and by a river bank for water flowers,
the floating heart, with small leaf like a heart,
and at the sinus under water a fist
of little fingers all kept down but one,
and that thrust up to blossom in the sun
as if to say 'you you're the heart's desire 
anne has a way with flowers to take the place
of that she's lost she goes down on one knee
and lifts their faces by the chin to hers
and says their names, and leaves them where they
are the lawyer wore a watch the case of which
was cunningly devised to make a noise
like a small pistol when he snapped it shut
at such a time as this he snapped it now 
well, anne, go, dearie our affair will wait 
the lawyer man is thinking of his train 
he wants to give me lots and lots of money
before he goes, because i hurt myself,
and it may take him i don't know how long 
but put our flowers in water first will, help her
the pitcher's too full for her there's no cup
just hook them on the inside of the pitcher 
now run get out your documents you see
i have to keep on the good side of anne 
i'm a great boy to think of number one 
and you can't blame me in the place i'm in 
who will take care of my necessities
unless i do a pretty interlude,
the lawyer said i'm sorry, but my train
luckily terms are all agreed upon 
you only have to sign your name right there 
you, will, stop making faces come round here
where you can't make them what is it you want
i'll put you out with anne be good or go 
you don't mean you will sign that thing unread
make yourself useful then, and read it for me 
isn't it something i have seen before
you'll find it is let your friend look at it 
yes, but all that takes time, and i'm as much
in haste to get it over with as you 
but read it, read it that's right, draw the curtain
half the time i don't know what's troubling me 
what do you say, will don't you be a fool 
you crumpling folkses' legal documents 
out with it if you've any real objection 
five hundred dollars what would you think right
a thousand wouldn't be a cent too much
you know it, mr lawyer the sin is
accepting anything before he knows
whether he's ever going to walk again 
it smells to me like a dishonest trick 
i think i think from what i heard to day
and saw myself he would be ill advised
what did you hear, for instance willis said 
now the place where the accident occurred
the broken one was twisted in his bed 
this is between you two apparently 
where i come in is what i want to know 
you stand up to it like a pair of cocks 
go outdoors if you want to fight spare me 
when you come back, i'll have the papers signed 
will pencil do then, please, your fountain pen 
one of you hold my head up from the pillow 
willis flung off the bed i wash my hands
i'm no match no, and don't pretend to be
the lawyer gravely capped his fountain pen 
you're doing the wise thing you won't regret it 
we're very sorry for you 
willis sneered who's we some stockholders in boston
i'll go outdoors, by gad and won't come back 
willis, bring anne back with you when you come 
yes thanks for caring don't mind will he's
savage he thinks you ought to pay me for my flowers 
you don't know what i mean about the flowers 
don't stop to try now you'll miss your train 
good bye he flung his arms around his face 
her word one ought not to have to care
so much as you and i
care when the birds come round the house
to seem to say good bye
or care so much when they come back
with whatever it is they sing
the truth being we are as much
too glad for the one thing
as we are too sad for the other here
with birds that fill their breasts
but with each other and themselves
and their built or driven nests 
always i tell you this they learned
always at night when they returned
to the lonely house from far away
to lamps unlighted and fire gone gray,
they learned to rattle the lock and key
to give whatever might chance to be
warning and time to be off in flight
and preferring the out to the in door night,
they learned to leave the house door wide
until they had lit the lamp inside 
her word i didn't like the way he went away 
that smile it never came of being gay 
still, he smiled did you see him i was sure
perhaps because we gave him only bread
and the wretch knew from that that we were poor 
perhaps because he let us give instead
of seizing from us as he might have seized 
perhaps he mocked at us for being wed,
or being very young (and he was pleased
to have a vision of us old and dead) 
i wonder how far down the road he's got 
he's watching from the woods as like as not 
she had no saying dark enough
for the dark pine that kept
forever trying the window latch
of the room where they slept 
the tireless but ineffectual hands
that with every futile pass
made the great tree seem as a little bird
before the mystery of glass
it never had been inside the room,
and only one of the two
was afraid in an oft repeated dream
of what the tree might do 
it was too lonely for her there,
and too wild, and since there were but two of them,
and no child, and work was little in the house,
she was free, and followed where he furrowed field,
or felled tree she rested on a log and tossed
the fresh chips, with a song only to herself
on her lips and once she went to break a bough
of black alder she strayed so far she scarcely heard
when he called her
and didn't answer didn't speak
or return she stood, and then she ran and hid
in the fern he never found her, though he looked
everywhere, and he asked at her mother's house
was she there sudden and swift and light as that
the ties gave, and he learned of finalities
besides the grave the buzz saw snarled and rattled in the yard
and made dust and dropped stove length sticks of
wood, sweet scented stuff when the breeze drew across it 
and from there those that lifted eyes could count
five mountain ranges one behind the other
under the sunset far into vermont 
and the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled,
as it ran light, or had to bear a load 
and nothing happened day was all but done 
call it a day, i wish they might have said
to please the boy by giving him the half hour
that a boy counts so much when saved from work 
his sister stood beside them in her apron
to tell them supper at the word, the saw,
as if to prove saws knew what supper meant,
leaped out at the boy's hand, or seemed to leap
he must have given the hand however it was,
neither refused the meeting but the hand
the boy's first outcry was a rueful laugh 
as he swung toward them holding up the hand
half in appeal, but half as if to keep
the life from spilling then the boy saw all
since he was old enough to know, big boy
doing a man's work, though a child at heart
he saw all spoiled don't let him cut my hand of
the doctor, when he comes don't let him, sister
so but the hand was gone already 
the doctor put him in the dark of ether 
he lay and puffed his lips out with his breath 
and then the watcher at his pulse took fright 
no one believed they listened at his heart 
little less nothing and that ended it 
no more to build on there and they, since they
were not the one dead, turned to their affairs 
you come to fetch me from my work to night
when supper's on the table, and we'll see
if i can leave off burying the white
soft petals fallen from the apple tree
soft petals, yes, but not so barren quite,
mingled with these, smooth bean and wrinkled
pea and go along with you ere you lose sight
of what you came for and become like me,
slave to a springtime passion for the earth 
how love bums through the putting in the seed
on through the watching for that early birth
when, just as the soil tarnishes with weed,
the sturdy seedling with arched body comes
shouldering its way and shedding the earth crumbs 
the well was dry beside the door,
and so we went with pail and can
across the fields behind the house
to seek the brook if still it ran
not loth to have excuse to go,
because the autumn eve was fair
though chill), because the fields were ours,
and by the brook our woods were there 
we ran as if to meet the moon
that slowly dawned behind the trees,
the barren boughs without the leaves,
without the birds, without the breeze 
but once within the wood, we paused
like gnomes that hid us from the moon,
ready to run to hiding new
with laughter when she found us soon 
each laid on other a staying hand
to listen ere we dared to look,
and in the hush we joined to make
we heard, we knew we heard the brook 
a note as from a single place,
a slender tinkling fall that made
now drops that floated on the pool
like pearls, and now a silver blade 
there was never a sound beside the wood but one,
and that was my long scythe whispering to the
ground what was it it whispered i knew not well myself
perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,
something, perhaps, about the lack of sound
and that was why it whispered and did not speak 
it was no dream of the gift of idle hours,
or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf
anything more than the truth would have seemed
too weak to the earnest love that laid the swale in rows,
not without feeble pointed spikes of flowers
pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake 
the fact is the sweetest dream that labour knows 
my long scythe whispered and left the hay to make 
my long two pointed ladder's sticking through a tree
toward heaven still, and there's a barrel that i didn't fill
beside it, and there may be two or three
apples i didn't pick upon some bough 
but i am done with apple picking now 
essence of winter sleep is on the night,
the scent of apples i am drowsing off 
i cannot rub the strangeness from my sight
i got from looking through a pane of glass
i skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
and held against the world of hoary grass 
it melted, and i let it fall and break 
but i was well
upon my way to sleep before it fell,
and i could tell
what form my dreaming was about to take 
magnified apples appear and disappear,
stem end and blossom end,
and every fleck of russet showing clear 
my instep arch not only keeps the ache,
it keeps the pressure of a ladder round 
i feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend 
and i keep hearing from the cellar bin
the rumbling sound of load on load of apples coming in 
for i have had too much
of apple picking i am overtired
of the great harvest i myself desired 
there were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,
cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall 
for all that struck the earth,
no matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,
went surely to the cider apple heap
as of no worth 
one can see what will trouble
this sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is 
were he not gone,
the woodchuck could say whether it's like his
long sleep, as i describe its coming on,
or just some human sleep 
when i see birches bend to left and right
across the lines of straighter darker trees,
i like to think some boy's been swinging them 
but swinging doesn't bend them down to stay 
ice storms do that often you must have seen them
loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
after a rain they click upon themselves
as the breeze rises, and turn many coloured
as the stir cracks and crazes their enamel 
soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal
shells shattering and avalanching on the snow crust
such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
you'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen 
they are dragged to the withered bracken by the
load, and they seem not to break though once they are
bowed so low for long, they never right themselves
you may see their trunks arching in the woods
years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground,
like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair
before them over their heads to dry in the sun 
but i was going to say when truth broke in
with all her matter of fact about the ice storm,
i should prefer to have some boy bend them
as he went out and in to fetch the cows
some boy too far from town to learn baseball,
whose only play was what he found himself,
summer or winter, and could play alone 
one by one he subdued his father's trees
by riding them down over and over again
until he took the stiffness out of them,
and not one but hung limp, not one was left
for him to conquer he learned all there was
to learn about not launching out too soon
and so not carrying the tree away
clear to the ground he always kept his poise
to the top branches, climbing carefully
with the same pains you use to fill a cup
up to the brim, and even above the brim 
then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,
kicking his way down through the air to the ground 
so was i once myself a swinger of birches 
and so i dream of going back to be 
it's when i'm weary of considerations,
and life is too much like a pathless wood
where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs
broken across it, and one eye is weeping
from a twig's having lashed across it open 
i'd like to get away from earth awhile
and then come back to it and begin over 
may no fate wilfully misunderstand me
and half grant what i wish and snatch me away
not to return earth's the right place for love
i don't know where it's likely to go better 
i'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,
and climb black branches up a snow white trunk
toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,
but dipped its top and set me down again 
that would be good both going and coming back 
one could do worse than be a swinger of birches 
there overtook me and drew me in
to his down hill, early morning stride,
and set me five miles on my road
better than if he had had me ride,
a man with a swinging bag for load
and half the bag wound round his hand 
we talked like barking above the din
of water we walked along beside 
and for my telling him where i'd been
and where i lived in mountain land
to be coming home the way i was,
he told me a little about himself 
he came from higher up in the pass
where the grist of the new beginning brooks
is blocks split off the mountain mass
and hopeless grist enough it looks
ever to grind to soil for grass 
the way it is will do for moss 
there he had built his stolen shack 
it had to be a stolen shack
because of the fears of fire and loss
that trouble the sleep of lumber folk
visions of half the world burned black
and the sun shrunken yellow in smoke 
we know who when they come to town
bring berries under the wagon seat,
or a basket of eggs between their feet
what this man brought in a cotton sack
was gum, the gum of the mountain spruce 
he showed me lumps of the scented stuff
like uncut jewels, dull and rough 
it comes to market golden brown
but turns to pink between the teeth 
i told him this is a pleasant life
to set your breast to the bark of trees
that all your days are dim beneath,
and reaching up with a little knife,
to loose the resin and take it down
and bring it to market when you please 
the mountain held the town as in a shadow 
i saw so much before i slept there once
i noticed that i missed stars in the west,
where its black body cut into the sky 
near me it seemed i felt it like a wall
behind which i was sheltered from a wind 
and yet between the town and it i found,
when i walked forth at dawn to see new things,
were fields, a river, and beyond, more fields 
the river at the time was fallen away,
and made a widespread brawl on cobble stones
but the signs showed what it had done in spring
good grass land gullied out, and in the grass
ridges of sand, and driftwood stripped of bark 
i crossed the river and swung round the mountain 
and there i met a man who moved so slow
with white faced oxen in a heavy cart,
it seemed no harm to stop him altogether 
what town is this i asked 
this lunenburg then i was wrong the town of my sojourn,
beyond the bridge, was not that of the mountain,
but only felt at night its shadowy presence 
where is your village very far from here
there is no village only scattered farms 
we were but sixty voters last election 
we can't in nature grow to many more
that thing takes all the room he moved his goad 
the mountain stood there to be pointed at 
pasture ran up the side a little way,
and then there was a wall of trees with trunks
after that only tops of trees, and cliffs
imperfectly concealed among the leaves 
a dry ravine emerged from under boughs
into the pasture that looks like a path 
is that the way to reach the top from here 
not for this morning, but some other time
i must be getting back to breakfast now 
i don't advise your trying from this side 
there is no proper path, but those that have
been up, i understand, have climbed from ladd's 
that's five miles back you can't mistake the place
they logged it there last winter some way up 
i'd take you, but i'm bound the other way 
you've never climbed it
i've been on the sides
deer hunting and trout fishing there's a brook
that starts up on it somewhere i've heard say
right on the top, tip top a curious thing 
but what would interest you about the brook,
it's always cold in summer, warm in winter 
one of the great sights going is to see
it steam in winter like an ox's breath 
until the bushes all along its banks
are inch deep with the frosty spines and bristles
you know the kind then let the sun shine on it
there ought to be a view around the world
from such a mountain if it isn't wooded
clear to the top i saw through leafy screens
great granite terraces in sun and shadow,
shelves one could rest a knee on getting up
with depths behind him sheer a hundred feet
or turn and sit on and look out and down,
with little ferns in crevices at his elbow v
as to that i can't say but there's the spring,
right on the summit, almost like a fountain 
that ought to be worth seeing 
if it's there you never saw it
i guess there's no doubt
about its being there i never saw it 
it may not be right on the very top
it wouldn't have to be a long way down
to have some head of water from above,
and a good distance down might not be noticed
by anyone who'd come a long way up 
one time i asked a fellow climbing it
to look and tell me later how it was 
what did he say
he said there was a lake
somewhere in ireland on a mountain top 
but a lake's different what about the spring
he never got up high enough to see 
that's why i don't advise your trying this side 
he tried this side i've always meant to go
and look myself, but you know how it is
it doesn't seem so much to climb a mountain
you've worked around the foot of all your life 
what would i do go in my overalls,
with a big stick, the same as when the cows
haven't come down to the bars at milking time
or with a shotgun for a stray black bear
twouldn't seem real to climb for climbing it 
i shouldn't climb it if i didn't want to
not for the sake of climbing what's its name
we call it hor i don't know if that's right 
can one walk round it would it be too far
you can drive round and keep in lunenburg,
but it's as much as ever you can do,
the boundary lines keep in so close to it 
hor is the township, and the township's hor
and a few houses sprinkled round the foot,
like boulders broken off the upper cliff,
rolled out a little farther than the rest 
warm in december, cold in june, you say
i don't suppose the waters changed at all 
you and i know enough to know it's warm
compared with cold, and cold compared with warm 
but all the fun's in how you say a thing 
you've lived here all your life
ever since hor was no bigger than a what, i did not hear 
he drew the oxen toward him with light touches
of his slim goad on nose and offside flank,
gave them their marching orders, and was moving 
i went to turn the grass once after one
who mowed it in the dew before the sun 
the dew was gone that made his blade so keen
before i came to view the levelled scene 
i looked for him behind an isle of trees
i listened for his whetstone on the breeze 
but he had gone his way, the grass all mown,
and i must be, as he had been alone,
as all must be, i said within my heart,
whether they work together or apart 
but as i said it, swift there passed me by
on noiseless wing a bewildered butterfly,
seeking with memories grown dim o'er night
some resting flower of yesterday's delight 
and once i marked his flight go round and round,
as where some flower lay withering on the ground 
and then he flew as far as eye could see,
and then on tremulous wing came back to me 
i thought of questions that have no reply,
and would have turned to toss the grass to dry
but he turned first, and led my eye to look
at a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook,
a leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared
beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared 
i left my place to know them by their name,
finding them butterfly weed when i came 
the mower in the dew had loved them thus,
by leaving them to flourish, not for us,
nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him 
but from sheer morning gladness at the brim 
the butterfly and i had lit upon,
nevertheless, a message from the dawn 
that made me hear the wakening birds around,
and hear his long scythe whispering to the ground,
and feel a spirit kindred to my own
so that henceforth i worked no more alone
but glad with him, i worked as with his aid,
and weary, sought at noon with him the shade
and dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech
with one whose thought i had not hoped to reach 
men work together, i told him from the heart,
whether they work together or apart 
something there is that doesn't love a wall,
that sends the frozen ground swell under it,
and spills the upper boulders in the sun
and makes gaps even two can pass abreast 
the work of hunters is another thing
i have come after them and made repair
where they have left not one stone on a stone,
but they would have the rabbit out of hiding,
to please the yelping dogs the gaps i mean,
no one has seen them made or heard them made,
but at spring mending time we find them there 
i let my neighbour know beyond the hill
and on a day we meet to walk the line
and set the wall between us once again 
we keep the wall between us as we go 
to each the boulders that have fallen to each 
and some are loaves and some so nearly balls
we have to use a spell to make them balance
stay where you are until our backs are turned
we wear our fingers rough with handling them 
oh, just another kind of out door game,
one on a side it comes to little more
there where it is we do not need the wall
he is all pine and i am apple orchard 
my apple trees will never get across
and eat the cones under his pines, i tell him 
he only says, good fences make good neighbours 
spring is the mischief in me, and i wonder
if i could put a notion in his head
why do they make good neighbours isn't it
where there are cows but here there are no cows 
before i built a wall i'd ask to know
what i was walling in or walling out,
and to whom i was like to give offence 
something there is that doesn't love a wall,
that wants it down i could say elves to him,
but it's not elves exactly, and i'd rather
he said it for himself i see him there
bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
in each hand, like an old stone savage armed 
he moves in darkness as it seems to me,
not of woods only and the shade of trees 
he will not go behind his father's saying,
and he likes having thought of it so well
he says again, good fences make good
neighbours once on the kind of day called weather breeder,
when the heat slowly hazes and the sun
by its own power seems to be undone,
i was half boring through, half climbing through,
a swamp of cedar choked with oil of cedar
and scurf of plants, and weary and over heated,
and sorry i ever left the road i knew,
i paused and rested on a sort of hook
that had me by the coat as good as seated,
and since there was no other way to look,
looked up toward heaven, and there against the
blue stood over me a resurrected tree,
a tree that had been down and raised again
a barkless spectre he had halted too,
as if for fear of treading upon me 
i saw the strange position of his hands
up at his shoulders, dragging yellow strands
of wire with something in it from men to men 
you here i said where aren't you nowadays
and what's the news you carry if you know
and tell me where you're off for montreal
me i'm not off for anywhere at all 
sometimes i wander out of beaten ways
half looking for the orchid calypso 
out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day
i paused and said, i will turn back from here 
no, i will go on farther and we shall see 
the hard snow held me, save where now and then
one foot went through the view was all in lines
straight up and down of tall slim trees
too much alike to mark or name a place by
so as to say for certain i was here
or somewhere else i was just far from home 
a small bird flew before me he was careful
to put a tree between us when he lighted,
and say no word to tell me who he was
who was so foolish as to think what he thought 
he thought that i was after him for a feather
the white one in his tail like one who takes
everything said as personal to himself 
one flight out sideways would have undeceived him 
and then there was a pile of wood for which
i forgot him and let his little fear
carry him off the way i might have gone,
without so much as wishing him good night 
he went behind it to make his last stand 
it was a cord of maple, cut and split
and piled and measured, four by four by eight 
and not another like it could i see 
no runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it 
and it was older sure than this year's cutting,
or even last year's or the year's before 
the wood was gray and the bark warping off it
and the pile somewhat sunken clematis
had wound strings round and round it like a bundle 
what held it though on one side was a tree
still growing, and on one a stake and prop,
these latter about to fall i thought that only
someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks
could so forget his handiwork on which
he spent himself, the labour of his axe,
and leave it there far from a useful fireplace
to warm the frozen swamp as best it could
with the slow smokeless burning of decay 
the three stood listening to a fresh access
of wind that caught against the house a moment,
gulped snow, and then blew free again the coles
dressed, but dishevelled from some hours of sleep,
meserve belittled in the great skin coat he wore 
meserve was first to speak he pointed backward
over his shoulder with his pipe stem, saying,
you can just see it glancing off the roof
making a great scroll upward toward the sky,
long enough for recording all our names on
i think i'll just call up my wife and tell her
i'm here so far and starting on again 
i'll call her softly so that if she's wise
and gone to sleep, she needn't wake to answer 
three times he barely stirred the bell, then listened 
why, lett, still up lett, i'm at cole's i'm late 
i called you up to say good night from here
before i went to say good morning there 
i thought i would i know, but, lett i know
i could, but what's the sense the rest won't be
so bad give me an hour for it ho, ho
three hours to here but that was all up hill
the rest is down why, no, no, not a wallow
they kept their heads and took their time to it
like darlings, both of them they're in the barn 
my dear, i'm coming just the same i didn't
call you to ask you to invite me home 
he lingered for some word she wouldn't say,
said it at last himself, good night, and then,
getting no answer, closed the telephone 
the three stood in the lamplight round the table
with lowered eyes a moment till he said,
i'll just see how the horses are 
yes, do, both the coles said together mrs cole
added you can judge better after seeing 
i want you here with me, fred leave him here,
brother meserve you know to find your way
out through the shed 
i guess i know my way,
i guess i know where i can find my name
carved in the shed to tell me who i am
if it don't tell me where i am i used
to play you tend your horses and come back 
fred cole, you're going to let him
well, aren't you how can you help yourself
i called him brother 
why did i call him that
it's right enough that's all you ever heard him called round here 
he seems to have lost off his christian name 
christian enough i should call that myself 
he took no notice, did he well, at least
i didn't use it out of love of him,
the dear knows i detest the thought of him
with his ten children under ten years old 
i hate his wretched little racker sect,
all's ever i heard of it, which isn't much 
but that's not saying look, fred cole, it's
twelve, isn't it, now he's been here half an hour 
he says he left the village store at nine 
three hours to do four miles a mile an hour
or not much better why, it doesn't seem
as if a man could move that slow and move 
try to think what he did with all that time 
and three miles more to go
don't let him go 
stick to him, helen make him answer you 
that sort of man talks straight on all his life
from the last thing he said himself, stone deaf
to anything anyone else may say 
i should have thought, though, you could make him
hear you what is he doing out a night like this
why can't he stay at home
he had to preach 
it's no night to be out 
he may be small,
he may be good, but one thing's sure, he's tough 
and strong of stale tobacco 
he'll pull through you only say so not another house
or shelter to put into from this place
to theirs i'm going to call his wife again 
wait and he may let's see what he will do 
let's see if he will think of her again 
but then i doubt he's thinking of himself 
he doesn't look on it as anything 
he shan't go there
it is a night, my dear 
one thing he dicing drag god into it 
he don't consider it a case for god 
you think so, do you you don't know the kind 
he's getting up a miracle this minute 
privately to himself, right now, he's thinking
he'll make a case of it if he succeeds,
but keep still if he fails 
keep still all over 
he'll be dead dead and buried 
such a trouble not but i've every reason not to care
what happens to him if it only takes
some of the sanctimonious conceit
out of one of those pious scalawags 
nonsense to that you want to see him safe 
you like the runt 
don't you a little
well, i don't like what he's doing, which is what
you like, and like him for 
oh, yes, you do 
you like your fun as well as anyone
only you women have to put these airs on
to impress men you've got us so ashamed
of being men we can't look at a good fight
between two boys and not feel bound to stop it 
let the man freeze an ear or two, i say 
he's here i leave him all to you go in
and save his life all right, come in, meserve
sit down, sit down how did you find the horses
fine, fine and ready for some more my wife here
says it won't do you've got to give it up 
won't you to please me please if i say please
mr meserve, i'll leave it to your wife 
what did your wife say on the telephone
meserve seemed to heed nothing but the lamp
or something not far from it on the table 
by straightening out and lifting a forefinger,
he pointed with his hand from where it lay
like a white crumpled spider on his knee
that leaf there in your open book it moved
just then, i thought it's stood erect like that,
there on the table, ever since i came,
trying to turn itself backward or forward,
i've had my eye on it to make out which
if forward, then it's with a friend's impatience
you see i know to get you on to things
it wants to see how you will take, if backward
it's from regret for something you have passed
and failed to see the good of never mind,
things must expect to come in front of us
a many times i don't say just how many
that varies with the things before we see them 
one of the lies would make it out that nothing
ever presents itself before us twice 
where would we be at last if that were so
our very life depends on everything's
recurring till we answer from within 
the thousandth time may prove the charm that
leaf it can't turn either way it needs the wind's help 
but the wind didn't move it if it moved 
it moved itself the wind's at naught in here 
it couldn't stir so sensitively poised
a thing as that it couldn't reach the lamp
to get a puff of black smoke from the flame,
or blow a rumple in the collie's coat 
you make a little foursquare block of air,
quiet and light and warm, in spite of all
the illimitable dark and cold and storm,
and by so doing give these three, lamp, dog,
and book leaf, that keep near you, their repose
though for all anyone can tell, repose
may be the thing you haven't, yet you give it 
so false it is that what we haven't we can't give
so false, that what we always say is true 
i'll have to turn the leaf if no one else will 
it won't lie down then let it stand who cares
i shouldn't want to hurry you, meserve,
but if you're going say you'll stay, you know
but let me raise this curtain on a scene,
and show you how it's piling up against you 
you see the snow white through the white of frost
ask helen how far up the sash it's climbed
since last we read the gage 
it looks as if
some pallid thing had squashed its features flat
and its eyes shut with overeagerness
to see what people found so interesting
in one another, and had gone to sleep
of its own stupid lack of understanding,
or broken its white neck of mushroom stuff
short off, and died against the window pane 
brother meserve, take care, you'll scare yourself
more than you will us with such nightmare talk 
it's you it matters to, because it's you
who have to go out into it alone 
let him talk, helen, and perhaps he'll stay 
before you drop the curtain i'm reminded
you recollect the boy who came out here
to breathe the air one winter had a room
down at the averys' well, one sunny morning
after a downy storm, he passed our place
and found me banking up the house with snow 
and i was burrowing in deep for warmth,
piling it well above the window sills 
the snow against the window caught his eye 
hey, that's a pretty thought' those were his
words so you can think it's six feet deep outside,
while you sit warm and read up balanced rations 
you can't get too much winter in the winter 
those were his words and he went home and
all but banked the daylight out of avery's windows 
now you and i would go to no such length 
at the same time you can't deny it makes
it not a mite worse, sitting here, we three,
playing our fancy, to have the snowline run
so high across the pane outside there where
there is a sort of tunnel in the frost
more like a tunnel than a hole way down
at the far end of it you see a stir
and quiver like the frayed edge of the drift
blown in the wind i like that i like that 
well, now i leave you, people 
come, meserve, we thought you were deciding not to go
the ways you found to say the praise of comfort
and being where you are you want to stay 
i'll own it's cold for such a fall of snow 
this house is frozen brittle, all except
this room you sit in if you think the wind
sounds further off, it's not because it's dying
you're further under in the snow that's all
and feel it less hear the soft bombs of dust
it bursts against us at the chimney mouth,
and at the eaves i like it from inside
more than i shall out in it but the horses
are rested and it's time to say good night,
and let you get to bed again good night,
sorry i had to break in on your sleep 
lucky for you you did lucky for you
you had us for a half way station
to stop at if you were the kind of man
paid heed to women, you'd take my advice
and for your family's sake stay where you are 
but what good is my saying it over and over
you've done more than you had a right to think
you could do now you know the risk you take
in going on our snow storms as a rule
aren't looked on as man killers, and although
i'd rather be the beast that sleeps the sleep
under it all, his door sealed up and lost,
than the man fighting it to keep above it,
yet think of the small birds at roost and not
in nests shall i be counted less than they are
their bulk in water would be frozen rock
in no time out to night and yet to morrow
they will come budding boughs from tree to tree
flirting their wings and saying chickadee,
as if not knowing what you meant by the word
storm but why when no one wants you to go on
your wife she doesn't want you to we don't,
and you yourself don't want to who else is there
save us from being cornered by a woman 
well, there's she told fred afterward that in
the pause right there, she thought the dreaded word
was coming, god but no, he only said
well, there's the storm that says i must go on 
that wants me as a war might if it came 
ask any man he threw her that as something
to last her till he got outside the door 
he had cole with him to the barn to see him off 
when cole returned he found his wife still standing
beside the table near the open book,
not reading it well, what kind of a man
do you call that she said 
he had the gift
of words, or is it tongues, i ought to say
was ever such a man for seeing likeness
or disregarding peopled civil questions
what we've found out in one hour more about
him than we had seeing him pass by in the road
a thousand times if that's the way he preaches
you didn't think you'd keep him after all 
oh, i'm not blaming you he didn't leave you
much say in the matter, and i'm just as glad
we're not in for a night of him no sleep
if he had stayed the least thing set him going 
it's quiet as an empty church without him 
but how much better off are we as it is
we'll have to sit here till we know he's safe 
yes, i suppose you'll want to, but i shouldn't 
he knows what he can do, or he wouldn't try 
get into bed i say, and get some rest 
he won't come back, and if he telephones,
it won't be for an hour or two 
well then we can't be any help by sitting here
and living his fight through with him, i suppose 
* cole had been telephoning in the dark 
mrs cole's voice came from an inner room
did she call you or you call her
she me you'd better dress you won't go back to bed 
we must have been asleep it's three and after 
had she been ringing long i'll get my wrapper 
i want to speak to her 
all she said was,
he hadn't come and had he really started 
she knew he had, poor thing, two hours ago 
he had the shovel hell have made a fight 
why did i ever let him leave this house
don't begin that you did the best you could
to keep him though perhaps you didn't quite
conceal a wish to see him show the spunk
to disobey you much his wife'll thank you 
fred, after all i said you shan't make out
that it was any way but what it was 
did she let on by any word she said
she didn't thank me
when i told her 'gone,
well then,' she said, and 'well then' like a
threat and then her voice came scraping slow 'oh, you,
why did you let him go
asked why we let him
you let me there i'll ask her why she let him 
she didn't dare to speak when he was here 
their number's twenty one the thing won't
work someone's receiver's down the handle stumbles 
the stubborn thing, the way it jars your arm
it's theirs she's dropped it from her hand and
gone try speaking say 'hello
hello, hello what do you hear
i hear an empty room
you know it sounds that way and yes, i hear
i think i hear a clock and windows rattling 
no step though if she's there she's sitting down 
shout, she may hear you 
shouting is no good 
keep speaking then hello hello hello 
you don't suppose she wouldn't go out doors
i'm half afraid that's just what she might do 
and leave the children
wait and call again 
you can't hear whether she has left the door
wide open and the wind's blown out the lamp
and the fire's died and the room's dark and cold
one of two things, either she's gone to bed
or gone out doors 
in which case both are lost 
do you know what she's like have you ever met
her it's strange she doesn't want to speak to us 
fred, see if you can hear what i hear come 
a clock maybe don't you hear something else
not talking no 
why, yes, i hear what is it
what do you say it is
a baby's crying frantic it sounds, though muffled and far off 
its mother wouldn't let it cry like that,
not if she's there 
what do you make of it
there's only one thing possible to make,
that is, assuming that she has gone out 
of course she hasn't though they both sat down
helpless there's nothing we can do till
morning fred, i shan't let you think of going out 
hold on the double bell began to chirp 
they started up fred took the telephone 
hello, meserve you're there, then and your
wife good why i asked she didn't seem to answer 
he says she went to let him in the barn 
we're glad oh, say no more about it, man 
drop in and see us when you're passing 
well she has him then, though what she wants him for
i don't see possibly not for herself 
maybe she only wants him for the children 
the whole to do seems to have been for nothing 
what spoiled our night was to him just his fun 
what did he come in for to talk and visit
thought he'd just call to tell us it was snowing 
if he thinks he is going to make our house
a halfway coffee house 'twixt town and
nowhere i thought you'd feel you'd been too much
concerned you think you haven't been concerned yourself 
if you mean he was inconsiderate
to rout us out to think for him at midnight
and then take our advice no more than nothing,
why, i agree with you but let's forgive him 
we've had a share in one night of his life 
what'll you bet he ever calls again
she stood against the kitchen sink, and looked
over the sink out through a dusty window
at weeds the water from the sink made tall 
she wore her cape her hat was in her hand 
behind her was confusion in the room,
of chairs turned upside down to sit like people
in other chairs, and something, come to look,
for every room a house has parlor, bed room,
and dining room thrown pell mell in the kitchen 
and now and then a smudged, infernal face
looked in a door behind her and addressed
her back she always answered without turning 
where will i put this walnut bureau, lady
put it on top of something that's on top
of something else, she laughed oh, put it where
you can to night, and go it's almost dark
you must be getting started back to town 
another blackened face thrust in and looked
and smiled, and when she did not turn, spoke
gently, what are you seeing out the window, lady
never was i beladied so before 
would evidence of having been called lady
more than so many times make me a lady
in common law, i wonder 
but i ask, what are you seeing out the window, lady
what i'll be seeing more of in the years
to come as here i stand and go the round
of many plates with towels many times 
and what is that you only put me off 
rank weeds that love the water from the dish pan
more than some women like the dish pan, joe
a little stretch of mowing field for you
not much of that until i come to woods
that end all and it's scarce enough to call
a view and yet you think you like it, dear
that's what you're so concerned to know you
hope i like it bang goes something big away
off there upstairs the very tread of men
as great as those is shattering to the frame
of such a little house once left alone,
you and i, dear, will go with softer steps
up and down stairs and through the rooms, and
none but sudden winds that snatch them from our hands
will ever slam the doors 
i think you see
more than you like to own to out that window 
no for besides the things i tell you of,
i only see the years they come and go
in alternation with the weeds, the field,
the wood what kind of years
why, latter years different from early years 
i see them, too 
you didn't count them
no, the further off
so ran together that i didn't try to 
it can scarce be that they would be in number
we'd care to know, for we are not young now 
and bang goes something else away off there 
it sounds as if it were the men went down,
and every crash meant one less to return
to lighted city streets we, too, have known,
but now are giving up for country darkness 
come from that window where you see too much
for me, and take a livelier view of things from here 
they're going watch this husky swarming up
over the wheel into the sky high seat,
lighting his pipe now, squinting down his nose
at the flame burning downward as he sucks it 
see how it makes his nose side bright, a proof
how dark it's getting can you tell what time
it is by that or by the moon the new moon
what shoulder did i see her over neither 
a wire she is of silver, as new as we
to everything her light won't last us long 
it's something, though, to know we're going to
have her night after night and stronger every night
to see us through our first two weeks but, joe,
the stove before they go knock on the window
ask them to help you get it on its feet 
we stand here dreaming hurry call them back
they're not gone yet 
we've got to have the stove,
whatever else we want for and a light 
have we a piece of candle if the lamp
and oil are buried out of reach
again the house was full of tramping, and the dark,
door filling men burst in and seized the stove 
a cannon mouth like hole was in the wall,
to which they set it true by eye and then
came up the jointed stovepipe in their hands,
so much too light and airy for their strength
it almost seemed to come ballooning up,
slipping from clumsy clutches toward the ceiling 
a fit said one, and banged a stovepipe shoulder 
it's good luck when you move in to begin
with good luck with your stovepipe never mind,
it's not so bad in the country, settled down,
when people 're getting on in life you'll like it 
joe said you big boys ought to find a farm,
and make good farmers, and leave other fellows
the city work to do there's not enough
for everybody as it is in there 
god one said wildly, and, when no one spoke
say that to jimmy here he needs a farm 
but jimmy only made his jaw recede
fool like, and rolled his eyes as if to say
he saw himself a farmer then there was a french
boy who said with seriousness that made them laugh,
ma friend, you ain't know what it is you're ask 
he doffed his cap and held it with both hands
across his chest to make as 'twere a bow
we're giving you our chances on de farm 
and then they all turned to with deafening boots
and put each other bodily out of the house 
goodby to them we puzzle them they think
i don't know what they think we see in what
they leave us to that pasture slope that seems
the back some farm presents us and your woods
to northward from your window at the sink,
waiting to steal a step on us whenever
we drop our eyes or turn to other things,
as in the game 'ten step' the children play 
good boys they seemed, and let them love the city 
all they could say was 'god ' when you proposed
their coming out and making useful farmers 
did they make something lonesome go through
you it would take more than them to sicken you
us of our bargain but they left us so
as to our fate, like fools past reasoning with 
they almost shook me 
it's all so much
what we have always wanted, i confess
it's seeming bad for a moment makes it seem
even worse still, and so on down, down, down 
it's nothing it's their leaving us at dusk 
i never bore it well when people went 
the first night after guests have gone, the house
seems haunted or exposed i always take
a personal interest in the locking up
at bedtime but the strangeness soon wears off 
he fetched a dingy lantern from behind
a door there's that we didn't lose and these
some matches he unpocketed for food
the meals we've had no one can take from us 
i wish that everything on earth were just
as certain as the meals we've had i wish
the meals we haven't had were, anyway 
what have you you know where to lay your hands
on the bread we bought in passing at the store 
there's butter somewhere, too 
let's rend the bread 
i'll light the fire for company for you
you'll not have any other company
till ed begins to get out on a sunday
to look us over and give us his idea
of what wants pruning, shingling, breaking up 
he'll know what he would do if he were we,
and all at once he'll plan for us and plan
to help us, but he'll take it out in planning 
well, you can set the table with the loaf 
let's see you find your loaf i'll light the fire 
i like chairs occupying other chairs
not offering a lady
there again, joe you're tired 
i'm drunk nonsensical tired out
don't mind a word i say it's a day's work
to empty one house of all household goods
and fill another with 'em fifteen miles away,
although you do no more than dump them down 
dumped down in paradise we are and happy 
it's all so much what i have always wanted,
i can't believe it's what you wanted, too 
shouldn't you like to know
i'd like to know
if it is what you wanted, then how much
you wanted it for me 
a troubled conscience you don't want me to tell if i don't know 
i don't want to find out what can't be known 
but who first said the word to come
my dear, it's who first thought the thought you're
searching, joe, for things that don't exist i mean beginnings 
ends and beginnings there are no such things 
there are only middles 
what is this this life
our sitting here by lantern light together
amid the wreckage of a former home
you won't deny the lantern isn't new 
the stove is not, and you are not to me,
nor i to you 
perhaps you never were
it would take me forever to recite
all that's not new in where we find ourselves 
new is a word for fools in towns who think
style upon style in dress and thought at last
must get somewhere i've heard you say as much 
no, this is no beginning 
then an end end is a gloomy word 
is it too late
to drag you out for just a good night call
on the old peach trees on the knoll to grope
by starlight in the grass for a last peach
the neighbors may not have taken as their right
when the house wasn't lived in i've been looking
i doubt if they have left us many grapes 
before we set ourselves to right the house,
the first thing in the morning, out we go
to go the round of apple, cherry, peach,
pine, alder, pasture, mowing, well, and brook 
all of a farm it is 
i know this much
i'm going to put you in your bed, if first
i have to make you build it come, the light 
when there was no more lantern in the kitchen,
the fire got out through crannies in the stove
and danced in yellow wrigglers on the ceiling,
as much at home as if they'd always danced there 
two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
and sorry i could not travel both
and be one traveller, long i stood
and looked down one as far as i could
to where it bent in the undergrowth
then took the other, as just as fair,
and having perhaps the better claim,
because it was grassy and wanted wear
though as for that the passing there
had worn them really about the same,
and both that morning equally lay
in leaves no step had trodden black 
oh, i kept the first for another day
yet knowing how way leads on to way,
i doubted if i should ever come back 
i shall be telling this with a sigh
somewhere ages and ages hence
two roads diverged in a wood, and i
i took the one less travelled by,
and that has made all the difference 
there is a singer everyone has heard,
loud, a mid summer and a mid wood bird,
who makes the solid tree trunks sound again 
he says that leaves are old and that for flowers
mid summer is to spring as one to ten 
he says the early petal fall is past
when pear and cherry bloom went down in showers
on sunny days a moment overcast
and comes that other fall we name the fall 
he says the highway dust is over all 
the bird would cease and be as other birds
but that he knows in singing not to sing 
the question that he frames in all but words
is what to make of a diminished thing 
if tired of trees i seek again mankind,
well i know where to hie me in the dawn,
to a slope where the cattle keep the lawn 
there amid lolling juniper reclined,
myself unseen, i see in white defined
far off the homes of men, and farther still,
the graves of men on an opposing hill,
living or dead, whichever are most to mind 
and if by noon i have too much of these,
i have but to turn on my arm, and lo,
the sun burned hillside sets my face aglow
my breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze,
i smell the earth, i smell the bruised plant,
i look into the crater of the ant 
i wonder about the trees 
why do we wish to bear
forever the noise of these
more than another noise
so close to our dwelling place
we suffer them by the day
till we lose all measure of pace,
and fixity in our joys,
and acquire a listening air 
they are that that talks of going
but never gets away
and that talks no less for knowing,
as it grows wiser and older,
that now it means to stay 
my feet tug at the floor
and my head sways to my shoulder
sometimes when i watch trees sway,
from the window or the door 
i shall set forth for somewhere,
i shall make the reckless choice
some day when they are in voice
and tossing so as to scare
the white clouds over them on 
i shall have less to say,
but i shall be gone 
by june our brook's run out of song and speed 
sought for much after that, it will be found
either to have gone groping underground
and taken with it all the hyla breed
that shouted in the mist a month ago,
like ghost of sleigh bells in a ghost of snow)
or flourished and come up in jewel weed,
weak foliage that is blown upon and bent
even against the way its waters went 
its bed is left a faded paper sheet
of dead leaves stuck together by the heat
a brook to none but who remember long 
this as it will be seen is other far
than with brooks taken otherwhere in song 
we love the things we love for what they are 
my sorrow, when she's here with me,
thinks these dark days of autumn rain
are beautiful as days can be
she loves the bare, the withered tree
she walks the sodden pasture lane 
her pleasure will not let me stay 
she talks and i am fain to list
she's glad the birds are gone away,
she's glad her simple worsted grey
is silver now with clinging mist 
the desolate, deserted trees,
the faded earth, the heavy sky,
the beauties she so truly sees,
she thinks i have no eye for these,
and vexes me for reason why 
not yesterday i learned to know
the love of bare november days
before the coming of the snow,
but it were vain to tell her so,
and they are better for her praise 
the battle rent a cobweb diamond strung
and cut a flower beside a ground bird's nest
before it stained a single human breast 
the stricken flower bent double and so hung 
and still the bird revisited her young 
a butterfly its fall had dispossessed
a moment sought in air his flower of rest,
then lightly stooped to it and fluttering clung 
on the bare upland pasture there had spread
o'ernight 'twixt mullein stalks a wheel of thread
and straining cables wet with silver dew 
a sudden passing bullet shook it dry 
the indwelling spider ran to greet the fly,
but finding nothing, sullenly withdrew 
o hushed october morning mild,
thy leaves have ripened to the fall
to morrow's wind, if it be wild,
should waste them all 
the crows above the forest call
to morrow they may form and go 
o hushed october morning mild,
begin the hours of this day slow,
make the day seem to us less brief 
hearts not averse to being beguiled,
beguile us in the way you know
release one leaf at break of day
at noon release another leaf
one from our trees, one far away
retard the sun with gentle mist
enchant the land with amethyst 
slow, slow for the grapes' sake, if they were all,
whose leaves already are burnt with frost,
whose clustered fruit must else be lost
for the grapes' sake along the wall 
come with rain, o loud southwester
bring the singer, bring the nester
give the buried flower a dream
make the settled snow bank steam
find the brown beneath the white
but whate'er you do to night,
bathe my window, make it flow,
melt it as the ice will go
melt the glass and leave the sticks
like a hermit's crucifix
burst into my narrow stall
swing the picture on the wall
run the rattling pages o'er
scatter poems on the floor
turn the poet out of door 
when a friend calls to me from the road
and slows his horse to a meaning walk
i don't stand still and look around
on all the hills i haven't hoed,
and shout from where i am, what is it
no, not as there is a time to talk 
i thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,
blade end up and five feet tall,
and plod i go up to the stone wall
for a friendly visit 
there were three in the meadow by the brook
gathering up windrows, piling cocks of hay,
with an eye always lifted toward the west
where an irregular sun bordered cloud
darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger
flickering across its bosom suddenly
one helper, thrusting pitchfork in the ground,
marched himself off the field and home one stayed 
the town bred farmer failed to understand 
what was there wrong
something you just now said 
what did i say
about our taking pains 
to cock the hay because it's going to shower
i said that more than half an hour ago 
i said it to myself as much as you 
you didn't know but james is one big fool 
he thought you meant to find fault with his work 
that's what the average farmer would have meant 
james would take time, of course, to chew it over
before he acted he's just got round to act 
he is a fool if that's the way he takes me 
don't let it bother you you've found out
something the hand that knows his business won't be told
to do work better or faster those two things 
i'm as particular as anyone
most likely i'd have served you just the same 
but i know you don't understand our ways 
you were just talking what was in your mind,
what was in all our minds, and you weren't hinting 
tell you a story of what happened once
i was up here in salem at a man's
named sanders with a gang of four or five
doing the haying no one liked the boss 
he was one of the kind sports call a spider,
all wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy
from a humped body nigh as big's a biscuit 
but work that man could work, especially
if by so doing he could get more work,
out of his hired help i'm not denying
he was hard on himself i couldn't find
that he kept any hours not for himself 
daylight and lantern light were one to him
i've heard him pounding in the barn all night 
but what he liked was someone to encourage 
them that he couldn't lead he'd get behind
and drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing
keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs
off i'd seen about enough of his bulling tricks
we call that bulling) i'd been watching him 
so when he paired off with me in the hayfield
to load the load, thinks i, look out for trouble 
i built the load and topped it off old sanders
combed it down with a rake and says, 'o k 
everything went well till we reached the barn
with a big jag to empty in a bay 
you understand that meant the easy job
for the man up on top of throwing down
the hay and rolling it off wholesale,
where on a mow it would have been slow lifting 
you wouldn't think a fellow'd need much urging
under those circumstances, would you now
but the old fool seizes his fork in both hands,
and looking up bewhiskered out of the pit,
shouts like an army captain, 'let her come
thinks i, d'ye mean it 'what was that you
said i asked out loud, so's there'd be no mistake,
did you say, let her come ' 'yes, let her come 
he said it over, but he said it softer 
never you say a thing like that to a man,
not if he values what he is god, i'd as soon
murdered him as left out his middle name 
i'd built the load and knew right where to find it 
two or three forkfuls i picked lightly round for
like meditating, and then i just dug in
and dumped the rackful on him in ten lots,
i looked over the side once in the dust
and caught sight of him treading water like,
keeping his head above 'damn ye,' i says,
that gets ye ' he squeaked like a squeezed rat 
that was the last i saw or heard of him 
i cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off 
as i sat mopping hayseed from my neck,
and sort of waiting to be asked about it,
one of the boys sings out, 'where's the old man
i left him in the barn under the hay 
if ye want him, ye can go and dig him out 
they realised from the way i swobbed my neck
more than was needed something must be up 
they headed for the barn i stayed where i was 
they told me afterward first they forked hay,
a lot of it, out into the barn floor 
nothing they listened for him not a rustle 
i guess they thought i'd spiked him in the temple
before i buried him, or i couldn't have managed 
they excavated more 'go keep his wife
out of the barn ' someone looked in a window,
and curse me if he wasn't in the kitchen
slumped way down in a chair, with both his feet
stuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer 
he looked so clean disgusted from behind
there was no one that dared to stir him up,
or let him know that he was being looked at 
apparently i hadn't buried him
i may have knocked him down) but my just
trying to bury him had hurt his dignity 
he had gone to the house so's not to meet me 
he kept away from us all afternoon 
we tended to his hay we saw him out
after a while picking peas in his garden
he couldn't keep away from doing something 
weren't you relieved to find he wasn't dead
no and yet i don't know it's hard to say 
i went about to kill him fair enough 
you took an awkward way did he discharge
you discharge me no he knew i did just right 
lancaster bore him such a little town,
such a great man it doesn't see him often
of late years, though he keeps the old homestead
and sends the children down there with their mother
to run wild in the summer a little wild 
sometimes he joins them for a day or two
and sees old friends he somehow can't get near 
they meet him in the general store at night,
preoccupied with formidable mail,
rifling a printed letter as he talks 
they seem afraid he wouldn't have it so
though a great scholar, he's a democrat,
if not at heart, at least on principle 
lately when coming up to lancaster
his train being late he missed another train
and had four hours to wait at woodsville junction
after eleven o'clock at night too tired
to think of sitting such an ordeal out,
he turned to the hotel to find a bed 
no room, the night clerk said unless
woodsville's a place of shrieks and wandering lamps
and cars that shock and rattle and one hotel 
you say 'unless unless you wouldn't mind
sharing a room with someone else 
who is it a man 
so i should hope what kind of man
i know him he's all right a man's a man 
separate beds of course you understand 
the night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on 
who's that man sleeping in the office chair
has he had the refusal of my chance
he was afraid of being robbed or murdered 
what do you say
i'll have to have a bed 
the night clerk led him up three flights of stairs
and down a narrow passage full of doors,
at the last one of which he knocked and entered,
lafe, here's a fellow wants to share your
room show him this way i'm not afraid of him,
i'm not so drunk i can't take care of myself 
the night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot 
this will be yours good night, he said, and
went lafe was the name, i think
yes, layfayette you got it the first time and yours
magoon doctor magoon 
a doctor well, a teacher 
professor square the circle till you're tired
hold on, there's something i don't think of now
that i had on my mind to ask the first
man that knew anything i happened in with 
i'll ask you later don't let me forget it 
the doctor looked at lafe and looked away 
a man a brute naked above the waist,
he sat there creased and shining in the light,
fumbling the buttons in a well starched shirt 
i'm moving into a size larger shirt 
i've felt mean lately mean's no name for it 
i just found what the matter was to night
i've been a choking like a nursery tree
when it outgrows the wide band of its name tag 
i blamed it on the hot spell we've been having 
twas nothing but my foolish hanging back,
not liking to own up i'd grown a size 
number eighteen this is what size do you wear
the doctor caught his throat convulsively 
oh ah fourteen fourteen 
fourteen you say so
i can remember when i wore fourteen 
and come to think i must have back at home
more than a hundred collars, size fourteen 
too bad to waste them all you ought to have them 
they're yours and welcome let me send them to
you what makes you stand there on one leg like that
you're not much furtherer than where kike left you,
you act as if you wished you hadn't come 
sit down or lie down friend you make me nervous 
the doctor made a subdued dash for it,
and propped himself at bay against a pillow 
not that way, with your shoes on kike's white
bed you can't rest that way let me pull your shoes
off don't touch me, please i say, don't touch me,
please i'll not be put to bed by you, my man 
just as you say have it your own way then 
my man' is it you talk like a professor 
speaking of who's afraid of who, however,
i'm thinking i have more to lose than you
if anything should happen to be wrong 
who wants to cut your number fourteen throat
let's have a show down as an evidence
of good faith there is ninety dollars 
come, if you're not afraid 
i'm not afraid there's five that's all i carry 
i can search you
where are you moving over to stay still 
you'd better tuck your money under you
and sleep on it the way i always do
when i'm with people i don't trust at night 
will you believe me if i put it there
right on the counterpane that i do trust you
you'd say so, mister man i'm a collector 
my ninety isn't mine you won't think that 
i pick it up a dollar at a time
all round the country for the weekly news,
published in bow you know the weekly news
known it since i was young 
then you know me 
now we are getting on together talking 
i'm sort of something for it at the front 
my business is to find what people want
they pay for it, and so they ought to have it 
fairbanks, he says to me he's editor
feel out the public sentiment he says 
a good deal comes on me when all is said 
the only trouble is we disagree
in politics i'm vermont democrat
you know what that is, sort of double dyed
the news has always been republican 
fairbanks, he says to me, 'help us this year,
meaning by us their ticket 'no,' i says,
i can't and won't you've been in long enough
it's time you turned around and boosted us 
you'll have to pay me more than ten a week
if i'm expected to elect bill taft 
i doubt if i could do it anyway 
you seem to shape the paper's policy 
you see i'm in with everybody, know 'em all 
i almost know their farms as well as they do 
you drive around it must be pleasant work 
it's business, but i can't say it's not fun 
what i like best's the lay of different farms,
coming out on them from a stretch of woods,
or over a hill or round a sudden corner 
i like to find folks getting out in spring,
raking the dooryard, working near the house 
later they get out further in the fields 
everything's shut sometimes except the barn
the family's all away in some back meadow 
there's a hay load a coming when it comes 
and later still they all get driven in
the fields are stripped to lawn, the garden patches
stripped to bare ground, the apple trees
to whips and poles there's nobody about 
the chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk
smoking and i lie back and ride i take the reins
only when someone's coming, and the mare
stops when she likes i tell her when to go 
i've spoiled jemima in more ways than one 
she's got so she turns in at every house
as if she had some sort of curvature,
no matter if i have no errand there 
she thinks i'm sociable i maybe am 
it's seldom i get down except for meals, though 
folks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep,
all in a family row down to the youngest 
one would suppose they might not be as glad
to see you as you are to see them 
oh, because i want their dollar i don't want
anything they've not got i never dun 
i'm there, and they can pay me if they like 
i go nowhere on purpose i happen by 
sorry there is no cup to give you a drink 
i drink out of the bottle not your style 
mayn't i offer you
no, no, no, thank you 
just as you say here's looking at you then 
and now i'm leaving you a little while 
you'll rest easier when i'm gone, perhaps
lie down let yourself go and get some sleep 
but first let's see what was i going to ask you
those collars who shall i address them to,
suppose you aren't awake when i come back
really, friend, i can't let you you may need
them not till i shrink, when they'll be out of style 
but really i have so many collars 
i don't know who i rather would have have them 
they're only turning yellow where they are 
but you're the doctor as the saying is 
i'll put the light out don't you wait for me
i've just begun the night you get some sleep 
i'll knock so fashion and peep round the door
when i come back so you'll know who it is 
there's nothing i'm afraid of like scared people 
i don't want you should shoot me in the head 
what am i doing carrying off this bottle
there now, you get some sleep 
he shut the door
the doctor slid a little down the pillow 
you ought to have seen what i saw on my way
to the village, through mortenson's pasture to day
blueberries as big as the end of your thumb,
real sky blue, and heavy, and ready to drum
in the cavernous pail of the first one to come
and all ripe together, not some of them green
and some of them ripe you ought to have seen
i don't know what part of the pasture you mean 
you know where they cut off the woods let me
see it was two years ago or no can it be
no longer than that and the following fall
the fire ran and burned it all up but the wall 
why, there hasn't been time for the bushes to
grow that's always the way with the blueberries, though
there may not have been the ghost of a sign
of them anywhere under the shade of the pine,
but get the pine out of the way, you may burn
the pasture all over until not a fern
or grass blade is left, not to mention a stick,
and presto, they're up all around you as thick
and hard to explain as a conjurer's trick 
it must be on charcoal they fatten their fruit 
i taste in them sometimes the flavour of soot 
and after all really they're ebony skinned
the blue's but a mist from the breath of the wind,
a tarnish that goes at a touch of the hand,
and less than the tan with which pickers are
tanned does mortenson know what he has, do you
think he may and not care and so leave the chewink
to gather them for him you know what he is 
he won't make the fact that they're rightfully his
an excuse for keeping us other folk out 
i wonder you didn't see loren about 
the best of it was that i did do you know,
i was just getting through what the field had to show
and over the wall and into the road,
when who should come by, with a democrat load
of all the young chattering lorens alive,
but loren, the fatherly, out for a drive 
he saw you, then what did he do did he
frown he just kept nodding his head up and down 
you know how politely he always goes by 
but he thought a big thought i could tell by his
eye which being expressed, might be this in effect
i have left those there berries, i shrewdly suspect,
to ripen too long i am greatly to blame 
he's a thriftier person than some i could name 
he seems to be thrifty and hasn't he need,
with the mouths of all those young lorens to feed
he has brought them all up on wild berries, they
say, like birds they store a great many away 
they eat them the year round, and those they
don't eat they sell in the store and buy shoes for their feet 
who cares what they say it's a nice way to live,
just taking what nature is willing to give,
not forcing her hand with harrow and plow 
i wish you had seen his perpetual bow
and the air of the youngsters not one of them
turned, and they looked so solemn absurdly concerned 
i wish i knew half what the flock of them know
of where all the berries and other things grow,
cranberries in bogs and raspberries on top
of the boulder strewn mountain, and when they
will crop i met them one day and each had a flower
stuck into his berries as fresh as a shower
some strange kind they told me it hadn't a name 
i've told you how once, not long after we came,
i almost provoked poor loren to mirth
by going to him of all people on earth
to ask if he knew any fruit to be had
for the picking the rascal, he said he'd be glad
to tell if he knew but the year had been bad 
there had been some berries but those were all
gone he didn't say where they had been he went on
i'm sure i'm sure' as polite as could be 
he spoke to his wife in the door, 'let me see,
marne, we don't know any good berrying place
it was all he could do to keep a straight face 
if he thinks all the fruit that grows wild is for him,
he'll find he's mistaken see here, for a whim,
we'll pick in the mortensons' pasture this year 
we'll go in the morning, that is, if it's clear,
and the sun shines out warm the vines must be
wet it's so long since i picked i almost forget
how we used to pick berries we took one look
round, then sank out of sight like trolls underground,
and saw nothing more of each other, or heard,
unless when you said i was keeping a bird
away from its nest, and i said it was you 
well, one of us is ' for complaining it flew
around and around us and then for a while
we picked, till i feared you had wandered a mile,
and i thought i had lost you i lifted a shout
too loud for the distance you were, it turned out,
for when you made answer, your voice was as low
as talking you stood up beside me, you know 
we shan't have the place to ourselves to enjoy
not likely, when all the young lorens deploy 
they'll be there to morrow, or even to night 
they won't be too friendly they may be polite
to people they look on as having no right
to pick where they're picking but we won't
complain you ought to have seen how it looked in the rain,
the fruit mixed with water in layers of leaves,
like two kinds of jewels, a vision for thieves 
brown lived at such a lofty farm
that everyone for miles could see
his lantern when he did his chores
in winter after half past three 
and many must have seen him make
his wild descent from there one night,
cross lots, 'cross walls, 'cross everything,
describing rings of lantern light 
between the house and barn the gale
got him by something he had on
and blew him out on the icy crust
that cased the world, and he was gone
walls were all buried, trees were few
he saw no stay unless he stove
a hole in somewhere with his heel 
but though repeatedly he strove
and stamped and said things to himself,
and sometimes something seemed to yield,
he gained no foothold, but pursued
his journey down from field to field 
sometimes he came with arms outspread
like wings, revolving in the scene
upon his longer axis, and
with no small dignity of mien 
faster or slower as he chanced,
sitting or standing as he chose,
according as he feared to risk
his neck, or thought to spare his clothes,
he never let the lantern drop 
and some exclaimed who saw afar
the figures he described with it,
i wonder what those signals are
brown makes at such an hour of night
he's celebrating something strange 
i wonder if he's sold his farm,
or been made master of the grange 
he reeled, he lurched, he bobbed, he checked
he fell and made the lantern rattle
but saved the light from going out) 
so half way down he fought the battle
incredulous of his own bad luck 
and then becoming reconciled
to everything, he gave it up
and came down like a coasting child 
well i be that was all he said,
as standing in the river road,
he looked back up the slippery slope
two miles it was) to his abode 
sometimes as an authority
on motor cars, i'm asked if i
should say our stock was petered out,
and this is my sincere reply
yankees are what they always were 
don't think brown ever gave up hope
of getting home again because
he couldn't climb that slippery slope
or even thought of standing there
until the january thaw
should take the polish off the crust 
he bowed with grace to natural law,
and then went round it on his feet,
after the manner of our stock
not much concerned for those to whom,
at that particular time o'clock,
it must have looked as if the course
he steered was really straight away
from that which he was headed for
not much concerned for them, i say 
but now he snapped his eyes three times
then shook his lantern, saying, ile's
bout out and took the long way home
by road, a matter of several miles 
we make ourselves a place apart
behind light words that tease and flout,
but oh, the agitated heart
till someone really find us out 
a pity if the case require
or so we say) that in the end
we speak the literal to inspire
the understanding of a friend 
but so with all, from babes that play
at hide and seek to god afar,
so all who hide too well away
must speak and tell us where they are 
when the wind works against us in the dark,
and pelts with snow
the lower chamber window on the east,
and whispers with a sort of stifled bark,
the beast, come out come out 
it costs no inward struggle not to go,
ah, do i count our strength,
two and a child,
those of us not asleep subdued to mark
how the cold creeps as the fire dies at length,
how drifts are piled,
dooryard and road ungraded,
till even the comforting barn grows far away,
and my heart owns a doubt
whether 'tis in us to arise with day
and save ourselves unaided 
love has earth to which she clings
with hills and circling arms about
wall within wall to shut fear out 
but thought has need of no such things,
for thought has a pair of dauntless wings 
on snow and sand and turf, i see
where love has left a printed trace
with straining in the world's embrace 
and such is love and glad to be 
but thought has shaken his ankles free 
thought cleaves the interstellar gloom
and sits in sirius' disc all night,
till day makes him retrace his flight,
with smell of burning on every plume,
back past the sun to an earthly room 
his gains in heaven are what they are 
yet some say love by being thrall
and simply staying possesses all
in several beauty that thought fares far
to find fused in another star 
i left you in the morning,
and in the morning glow,
you walked a way beside me
to make me sad to go 
do you know me in the gloaming,
gaunt and dusty grey with roaming
are you dumb because you know me not,
or dumb because you know
all for me and not a question
for the faded flowers gay
that could take me from beside you
for the ages of a day
they are yours, and be the measure
of their worth for you to treasure,
the measure of the little while
that i've been long away 
out through the fields and the woods
and over the walls i have wended
i have climbed the hills of view
and looked at the world, and descended
i have come by the highway home,
and lo, it is ended 
the leaves are all dead on the ground,
save those that the oak is keeping
to ravel them one by one
and let them go scraping and creeping
out over the crusted snow,
when others are sleeping 
and the dead leaves lie huddled and still,
no longer blown hither and thither
the last lone aster is gone
the flowers of the witch hazel wither
the heart is still aching to seek,
but the feet question whither
ah, when to the heart of man
was it ever less than a treason
to go with the drift of things,
to yield with a grace to reason,
and bow and accept the end
of a love or a season
one of my wishes is that those dark trees,
so old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,
were not, as 'twere, the merest mask of gloom,
but stretched away unto the edge of doom 
i should not be withheld but that some day
into their vastness i should steal away,
fearless of ever finding open land,
or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand 
i do not see why i should e'er turn back,
or those should not set forth upon my track
to overtake me, who should miss me here
and long to know if still i held them dear 
they would not find me changed from him they
knew only more sure of all i thought was true
